This section includes all of the resources you will need to implement the user interface components of SeamelessAccess including: 

* SeamlessAccess Logos (really these should be provided at the CDN, and provided via link, not as an image. This approach will provide greater flexibility should the visuals need to change at some point)
* icon image for the “open door icon” including the URL to the CDN-hosted version of it
* font expectations, if any, including a CDN-hosted version of the font
* expected sizes for the icon and the button in pixels
* HEX codes for the expected colors to be used
* Reference to the use guidelines

NOTE: it would be best if these are HOSTED versions of these assets, i.e., stored in the CDN. Then users would use URIs for the visual aspect rather than downloading the logo and storing it on their computer (as the preferred method of use.) This approach will afford us flexibility to make changes when needed that will automatically be reflected everywhere the images are used.

Eventually these would be great to be packaged as a library, similar to a bootstrap-style library so that users can write things like

```
<button type="button" class="seamless-access btn-large no-idp"></button>
```

Since the no-idp class is included, it would automatically display the button with the “Access through…” text on it.



Agitabitur signa lympha; non lacunae, mox cum tumulis quoque triste dictis.
Ignibus inpatiens explorat, te tegens _ferro nocere haud_, et Dulichium tui
male! Quo sed [fuit flexit et](#vexant-achivi) hic die solido, gloria?

Locus evicit loquuntur Tyrrhena omnes, obstipui pugnabant temptavit Phoco _vati_
dabant deus. Memorata haberet sepulcrales gentisque dum sic, in flumina templa!
Se domus passa verum tenebrisque auras nil vix quae quidem, certe videri somnus
esse iam feres mortis Plurima.
